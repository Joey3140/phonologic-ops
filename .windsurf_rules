# Phonologic Agentic Orchestrator - Windsurf Rules
# These rules ensure Agno-native patterns are always used

## Framework Constraints
- ALWAYS use Agno (formerly Phidata) for all agent implementations
- NEVER use CrewAI, LangChain, or AutoGPT patterns
- NEVER create custom task-sequencing engines or agent managers
- NEVER use manual JSON parsing for agent communication

## Agno-Specific Patterns
- Use Agno's native `Team` class with `coordinate=True` for multi-agent workflows
- Use Agno's built-in `SqliteStorage` or `PostgresStorage` for state persistence
- Use Agno's native toolkits: `DuckDuckGoTools`, `PlaywrightTools`, `FileTools`
- Use functional tool-calling with Agno's standard tool-transfer mechanism
- Define agent instructions clearly; avoid overly complex prompting

## Code Style for Agents
- All agent outputs should use Pydantic `response_model` for structured data
- Create custom `Toolkit` classes that extend Agno's base Toolkit
- Use `Agent.run()` for synchronous execution, `Agent.arun()` for async
- Configure teams with `mode=TeamRunMode.COORDINATE` for handoff-based workflows

## Storage & State
- Use Agno's `SqliteStorage(db_file="agents.db")` for local development
- Use `PostgresStorage` for production deployments
- Enable `add_history_to_messages=True` for conversational memory

## Tool Implementation
- Create tools as methods decorated with appropriate docstrings
- Tools should return structured data, not raw strings when possible
- Use `httpx` or `requests` for API calls within tools
- Handle errors gracefully and return error states to the agent

## Browser/Playwright Agent
- Use `PlaywrightTools` from agno.tools.playwright
- Set `headless=False` during development for visual debugging
- Agent should report screen state back to orchestrator

## Debugging
- Use Agno Studio for visual traces: `pip install agno && agno dev`
- Enable `debug_mode=True` on agents during development
- Log all tool calls and responses for observability
